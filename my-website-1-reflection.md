#Explain how to create a repository on GitHub and clone the repository to your local computer to a non-technical person.
Creating a repository is as simple as pushing the plus sign on the top right of the Github page,clicking new repository, giving it a memorable name, and clicking the big green create repository button at the bottom of the screen. You have a few choices during creation, including making the repository viewable by anybody or only by people of you choosing, as well as choosing to add a license to your repository.
Cloning the repository is a little trickier, but still very simple when you break it down. First, find the URL on the repository's main page, it should be right in the middle of the screen if you're at the top of the page. Copy that and save it for later. Then you just have to open your terminal and find the folder where you want to save your repository. This can be done using only 3 commands, pwd to figure out where you are, ls to figure out the contents of the folder youre in, and cd folder_name to navigate to that folder. Once you're there, you just write git clone command+v and your repository is cloned on your computer. Easy as pie.

#Describe what open source means.

Open source means that the source code to your software is freely available for anybody to download and customize. Anybody can build on it or share it as they please.
#What do you think about Open Source? Does it make you nervous or protective? Does it feel like utopia?
I see the value in both Open Source projects and more protected software. Without software copyright, there would be no IP and no tech businesses, but without open source projects, software couldn't be as collaborative and flexible, and there would be a lot less free software out there.
#Assess the importance of using licenses.

Licenses determine how and by whom the software can be used. Depending on the license, what collaborators and customers are able to do with a particular piece of software is either more or less restricted, letting software companies protect their intellectual property or letting an open source project be freely shared and modified without worrying about IP infringement.

#What concepts were solidified in the challenge? Did you have any "aha" moments? What did you struggle with?
The only thing I struggled with was during cloning, when I mixed up the pull and clone commands, and I was wondering it wasn't working. Other than that, I found that everything had begun to settle into place, and the commands I used frequently had become like muscle memory.
#Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
I found the DBC instructions more than sufficient.
