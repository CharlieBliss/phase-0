<!--
- What was it like to translate your previous learning with HTML into an actual site?

It was pretty exciting seeing it all come together, especially when I had to learn new commands that I wasn't already familiar with, such as <hr>. Seeing them work through JSFiddle, especially on the first try,was really a rush every time, and the closer it got to looking like the actual page, the more confident I felt moving forward.
- How was it researching and using semantic HTML5 elements?
The semantic elements of HTML5 are all pretty simple and logical, so I didn't struggle a ton. Learning new commands and context on the ones I knew was as simple as googling what I needed. I am a little concerned about the upcoming CSS material, since my eye for design is not particularly keen just yet.

- How did you do at keeping to best practices (i.e. no formatting in the HTML)
The only formatting we really did was trying to make the title a header at first, but realizing that wasn't how we wanted it to look. We also used <hr> to make the lines, but I think that was alright to do in HTML, since it appears in the example picture.
- What seems good and bad about HTML?
HTML seems really simple, which is both a good and bad thing. Because of its simplicity, it's incredibly easy to put together a simple webpage, but as a result, you can't rely on it for more than that. Any design seems to have to go through CSS, and it seems like you need a scripting language if you want anything more complicated.

- What tricks do you have for remembering how to write HTML?
I didn't think I really needed any tricks. The structure commands basically tell me to set up the page like a human body, and, with the exception of link formatting, everything does exactly what it tells me it's going to do. I'd be happy to hear about other people's tricks, but I didn't find myself struggling to remember any of the commands.
