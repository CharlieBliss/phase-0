What are the 6 Phases of Web Design?

The 6 phases of Web Design are
##1:Information gathering
A designer will establish the information he needs to begin constructing the website. Its purpose, goals, audience, and content should all be established in this phase.
##2.Planning
Once the information is gathered, a designer creates a site map, plans the interface, and decides what technologies will be implemented into the website.
##3. Design
This is where the look and feel/experience of the website will be determined in plans. This should be tailored to your target audience and company branding. Design protoypes will be drawn up here.
##4. Development
Wherein the developer actually creates the site. Here, the prototype design elements will be implemented into the actual website.Usually the home page will be created first, followed by a skeleton of the navigational structure of the website. Once the skeleton is created, the designer can implement the content and destribute it. Here all the technologies chosen during planning will be incorporated.
##5. Testing and delivery
Here is where the functionality of the now-complete website will be tested. All of the code should be valid and meet web dev standards. It should also be functional across modern browsers. The website is uploaded to a server using FTP, and should here be tested again for functionality. Finally, the website should be optimized with SEO and plugins.
##6. Maintenance
Maintenance includes updates with new content or products to attract repeat visitors. If you use a Content Management System, you can edit the content areas of your website yourself, as well as add new pages and content. The extent to which you perform maintenance yourself is flexible and up to personal preference.
#What is your site's primary goal or purpose? What kind of content will your site feature?
My site's goal is to establish a basis from which I can demonstrate my professional self. It will grow to include my projects, skills, and thoughts on a platform that I can feel confident showing to potential colleagues and employers.
#What is your target audience's interests and how do you see your site addressing them?
My audience's interest will be seeing what I am capable of in my capacity as a web dev. To this end, my portfolio, my history, and my contact information will be available.

#What is the primary "action" the user should take when coming to your site? Do you want them to search for information, contact you, or see your portfolio? It's ok to have several actions at once, or different actions for different kinds of visitors.
Ideally, my portfolio will be the focus of the website, and any information they need, particularly contact info, will be readily available and easily accessible.
#What are the main things someone should know about design and user experience?
It's very difficult to overstate the importance of planning when it comes to design. Without working from a idea and a map, it's impossible to create a website that will look and function the way you want. Design isn't just what the website will look like, it's the way the website flows and functions, and a persons ability to get around in that space is just as important as the aesthetics of the space. As websites grow more complex and more interactive, this concept of user experience and ease of use becomes more important.
#What is user experience design and why is it valuable?
User experience design is the process of creating a comfortable and efficient interface for a website. Simply put, it's the process that makes a website feel good to use. An easy, pleasant website will draw users back, while something diffucult to use and navigate will drive people away.
#Which parts of the challenge did you find tedious?
I'm not sure tedious is really the right word, but I found visualizing the website I wanted to create a little out of my reach. Maybe because I don't have any experience with putting together a website, but the map didn't help me visualize a product the way I think it was supposed to.
