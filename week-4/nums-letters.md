#What does puts do?
puts prints to the console a value returned or given to ruby on a new line. This differs from print, which doesn't separate the results by line, and p, which both returns a value, and prints to the console without separating the results by line.

#What is an integer? What is a float?
An integer is any number without a decimal point, a float is any number with one.

What is the difference between float and integer division? How would you explain the difference to someone who doesn't know anything about programming?

#Float division is what most people would conisder "regular division." You take a number and divide it by another number. The result is what the result is. Maybe it has a decimal, maybe not. Integer division always rounds down to the nearest integer for a cleaner result. Even if the "right" answer has a decimal, integer division will force a returned quotient to be an integer.

How does Ruby handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of numbers?

What are strings? Why and when would you use them?
  Strings are sequences of letters, often words, that ruby interprets as-is. Strings are useful in providing input and output that a user can understand rather than integers, variables, methods, or floats. For instance, when you put your username into a website, it is interpreted as a string and saved that way.

What are local variables? Why and when would you use them?

Local variables are used to refer to a value, either fixed or flexible, in a way that is assigned by the user or the program. Local variables are some of the most important elements in ruby, since they allow values to be stored, manipulated, and recalled at will by the program. This allows for greater complexity and flexibility, as well as saving a great deal of time, as opposed to using all constant values.


How was this challenge? Did you get a good review of some of the basics?

This was a fine review of the basics. I found myself getting a little impatient reading things that I already knew, but when I went back to try things out, my hubris was punished and I found that I didn't remember things as well as I thought I had. It's always good explaining what things do, since I always get a better understanding of them as I explain.
