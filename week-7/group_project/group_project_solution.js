1. Calculating a sum
Declare a function that takes two arguments
ADD the arguments together
RETURN the sum

2. Calculating the sum of an array with an odd length

Declare a function that takes an array as an argument
IF the length of that array is NOT divisible by 2
  ADD all the numbers in the array together
  RETURN the sum
ELSE
  do nothing

3. Calculating the sum of an array with an even length
Declare a function that takes an array as an argument
IF the length of that array is divisible by 2
  ADD all the numbers in the array together
  RETURN the sum
ELSE
  do nothing

4. Calculating a mean
Declare a function that takes an array as an argument
ADD the numbers together
DIVIDE the sum of those numbers by the number of elements in the array
RETURN the quotient

5. Calculating the mean of an array with an odd length
Declare a function that takes an array as an argument
  IF the length of that array is NOT divisible by 2
    ADD the numbers together
    DIVIDE the sum of those numbers by the number of elements in the array
    RETURN the quotient
  ELSE do nothinng.

6. Calculating the mean of an array with an even length

7. Calculate the median
  Declare a function that takes an array as an argument
  IF the length of that array is divisible by 2
    DIVIDE the length of the array by 2
    RETURN the element at that index of the array
  ELSE
    DIVIDE the length of the array by 2
    DIVIDE the length of the array by 2 and subtract 1
    RETURN the sum of the elements at those indeces of the array

8.Calculate the median of an array with an odd number of elements
